49307,516,5,2013-12-30 19:20:00,"""Kien Giang""","""I came here with a friend after a nice hike at Percy Warner and ordered the rare steak pho along with an Vietnamese Iced Coffee and was mildly surprised to say that it was just as authentic as the best pho places in Los Angeles (which is saying a lot).  The steak came out rare (which for a lot of pho places is never the case despite the printing on the menu) and the coffee was served very uniquely in a drop container that I had to pour into a cup of ice myself. Not that the work was troublesome, but it was the first time I had ever seen the coffee served in that fashion and the pricing was pretty fair.

But like some other people have mentioned, the service here can be a hit or miss. I've come several times before and on some days it's just the regular routine of ordering, eating, paying, and out. On some days however, service can be down right awful when the staff seems to be having a bad day and it almost seems as if they take it out on you. It hasn't happened to me often, but in some of the worst scenarios, they don't even wipe the table very clean before they ""order"" you to sit down. Despite that though, I'd still come back here to get a bowl of good 'ol fashion pho.

The bar service was equal to going to broadway- order, get the drink, and they walk away after you get it. I'm not expecting a full conversation but some interaction would be nice- especially since it's a new location. ""Hey, how are y'all? Have you been to Tailgate before? Would you like to sample anything? This is what we have new, you should try it?"" BASIC restaurant conversation- we got none. I would have asked for a new beer if it didn't take having to reach over the counter just to flag down the bartender in order to order our pizza (for which we got charged $1.99 for swapping a meat- that we do at other locations with no charge). Pizza was lacking toppings too. I would suggest y'all get on the same page for every location. I don't mind paying extra for ranch when it's homemade (like other locations) but not a fan when it's from a jar. We just hurried up and left to go elsewhere.
